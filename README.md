# Movies Recommender System

This is a reommender system building with movies rating

The whole system segments users as **New User** and **Exsiting User** and apply different analysis on each segment.

## New User

## Exsiting User
For exsiting user, we used collaborative filtering analysis to get the users' protential preferences.

The preprocessing process is the process performing matrix factorization.

In this project, I used two methods to apply Sigular Value Decomposition:

 + Stochastic Gradient Descent
 + Alternating Least Squares
